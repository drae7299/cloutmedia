          We wanted to create a special platform just for artists and engineers
          to find each other. We decided that there was a better way compared to
          Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Introducing Clout. Clout is only for
          Artists and Musicans. We wanted to remove the distractions that Fans
          that make it harder to get revelant answers to questions posted on
          social media without having a bunch of comments not related to the
          topic at hand.
